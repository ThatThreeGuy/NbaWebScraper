A fun little side-project i did to learn about web-scraping


The only thing that you really need to know is that the player's names inputs happen from first-name to last-name. (e.g. - Lebron James and not James Lebron)


There is also an auto-correct system, that will work if no player is found under a certain Name + Surname. (e.g. Stephen Cirry)
